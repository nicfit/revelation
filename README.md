Revelation is a password manager for the GNOME 3 desktop, released
under the GNU GPL license. It stores accounts and passwords in a single,
secure place, and gives access to them through a user-friendly graphical
interface.

This is a fork of http://revelation.olasagasti.info/ to make it work
using Gtk3 and Python 3.

Revelation depends on the following software:

- PyGObject
- Python 3 (currently working on Python 3.7)
- Crypto
- pycrypto 1.9
- cracklib
- dbus
